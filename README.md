In the dynamic world of aviation, where reliability and safety are paramount, the development of a robust regression model for predicting the remaining useful life of critical aircraft 
components stands as a crucial endeavor. Drawing upon historical maintenance data, flight conditions, and sensor readings, such a model emerges as a strategic tool for proactive maintenance planning, 
with far-reaching implications for minimizing unscheduled downtime and optimizing operational efficiency.Consider the consequences of unplanned maintenance, flight delays and cancellations. 
It's not merely an inconvenience, itâ€™s a financial burden that resonates throughout the entire aviation ecosystem. The domino effect of a single unscheduled maintenance event can disrupt an airline's entire schedule, 
affecting passengers, cargo, and crew. The economic toll is substantial, and the repercussions extend well beyond the financial realm.
Throughout their operational lifespan, aircraft components undergo degradation that directly impacts their reliability and performance. T
his machine learning initiative aims to establish a comprehensive framework for predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of aircraft based on their entire life cycle data. 
The objective is to facilitate informed maintenance decisions. I have chose to implement two regression models, Linear Regression and Random Forest and will evaluate them using NASA's C-MAPSS dataset from Kaggle, 
to assess engine lifetime. This is generally a regression task, as the target is a continous list of numbers.
I will therefore use a LinearRegression model which is normally used for regression tasks like this one and also i will use Random Forest which are normally used for classification problems and
